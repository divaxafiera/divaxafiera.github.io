	<h2>Name</h2>
		<p>My fullname is Diva Xafiera Barlianto, and my friends used to call me Diva. But I have a lot of nickname such as Daeb, Debbie, Vanya, and even Safi.</p>
		<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
			<p>Actually my name is Xaviera. But back to 01's the internet was quiet hard to be accessed and my mom forgot how to spell "Xaviera". Beacause of that my name uses F instead of V.</p>
